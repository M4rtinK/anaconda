Subject: [master][PATCH 0/3] Makeupdates version handling improvements

The first patches add support for fetching older packages for a newer
Fedora release. This is 100% valid: while the package might have been built
for an older release, provided there was no update since then it is still
valid (and tagged in Koji) for newer Fedora releases.

The second patch makes sure such packages are picked up from the package cache.
They are stored in a separate folder per Fedora release, so that makeupdates
can discern between packages that are really outdated and those that were just not
updated in the latest Fedora release.

The third patch fixes issues with long build ids in some packages,
that were preventing those packages to be picked-up from the cache.

Martin Kolman (3):
  Fetch older valid releases
  Store older valid packages in separate folder
  Fix handling of long release ids
