    Add help placeholders
    
    These place holders are used as a fallback in case that the
    installation guide is not available in the installation environment in
    any form. There are two placeholder variant, one for the livecd
    installation environment with clickable links and one for the
    installation media without clickable links.

Subject: [anaconda][master][rhel7-branch][PATCH 0/2] Don't create configured.ini & fix typos

The first patch drops some old code we probably wanted to use early in the Initial Setup
development but never did in the end. The end result is that we will no longer needlessly
create the configured.ini file in the /var/lib/inital_setup folder (yes, there is even a
spelling mistake in the path - we would probably never know about it if the mistake was no
there :) ).

The second patch fixes a few typos I've discovered while working on the first patch.
