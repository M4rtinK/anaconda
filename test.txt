Subject: [anaconda][master][PATCH] Replace urlgrabber usage by python-requests

Replace the Python 2-only urlgrabber with the Python 3 compatible (and much nicer ;-) )
python-requests library.

The requests API maps quite nicely to the stuff we did with urlgrabber and should
have the same end result & behavior as before.

The only potential mismatch I've found I found is in SSL certificate verification,
the urlgrabber API has two options - ssl_verify_host and ssl_verify_peer, while
request just have a single verify option. We used to set both options always to True
or to False with urlgrabber, so unless requests are skipping some verification urlgrabber
did, so this should be probably fine.

Certificate validation itself seem to work fine as far as I can tell - connections to
server with valid certificates work fine and servers with self-signed certificates raise
an exception.

  Replace python-urlgrabber with python-requests (#1141242)
